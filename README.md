# Project Name: RNN Stock Price Prediction

## General Information

### Project Information

- The problem statement for this assignment can be summarised as follows: 
"Given the stock prices of Amazon, Google, IBM, and Microsoft for a set number of days, predict the stock price of these companies after that window."

### Project Background

- The objective of this project is to try and predict the stock prices using historical data from four companies: IBM (IBM), Google (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT).
- We use four different companies because they belong to the same sector: Technology.
- Using data from all four companies may improve the performance of the model.
- This way, we can capture the broader market sentiment.

### Data Set
The dataset consists of four CSV files corresponding to four stocks: AMZN, GOOGL, IBM, and MSFT. The files contain historical data that were gathered from the websites of the stock markets where these companies are listed: NYSE and NASDAQ.

There are more than 3000 records for each company spread across the years. The columns in all four files are identical, which are:
- Date: The values in this column specify the date on which the values were recorded. In all four files, the dates range from January 1, 2006, to January 1, 2018.
- Open: The values in this column specify the stock price on a given date when the stock market opens.
- High: The values in this column specify the highest stock price achieved by a stock on a given date.
- Low: The values in this column specify the lowest stock price achieved by a stock on a given date.
- Close: The values in this column specify the stock price on a given date when the stock market closes.
- Volume: The values in this column specify the total number of shares traded on a given date.
- Name: This column gives the official name of the stock as used in the stock market.
